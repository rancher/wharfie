# providers is a list of credential provider plugins that will be enabled by the kubelet.
# Multiple providers may match against a single image, in which case credentials
# from all providers will be returned to the kubelet. If multiple providers are called
# for a single image, the results are combined. If providers return overlapping
# auth keys, the value from the provider earlier in this list is used.
providers:
  # name is the required name of the credential provider. It must match the name of the
  # provider executable as seen by the kubelet. The executable must be in the kubelet's
  # bin directory (set by the --image-credential-provider-bin-dir flag).
  - name: ecr-credential-provider
    # matchImages is a required list of strings used to match against images in order to
    # determine if this provider should be invoked. If one of the strings matches the
    # requested image from the kubelet, the plugin will be invoked and given a chance
    # to provide credentials. Images are expected to contain the registry domain
    # and URL path.
    #
    # Each entry in matchImages is a pattern which can optionally contain a port and a path.
    # Globs can be used in the domain, but not in the port or the path. Globs are supported
    # as subdomains like '*.k8s.io' or 'k8s.*.io', and top-level-domains such as 'k8s.*'.
    # Matching partial subdomains like 'app*.k8s.io' is also supported. Each glob can only match
    # a single subdomain segment, so *.io does not match *.k8s.io.
    #
    # A match exists between an image and a matchImage when all of the below are true:
    # - Both contain the same number of domain parts and each part matches.
    # - The URL path of an imageMatch must be a prefix of the target image URL path.
    # - If the imageMatch contains a port, then the port must match in the image as well.
    #
    # Example values of matchImages:
    # - 123456789.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
    # - *.azurecr.io
    # - gcr.io
    # - *.*.registry.io
    # - registry.io:8080/path
